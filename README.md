## About the project

[![Neutronium Screenshot][project-splash]](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-rust)

This repository is a template for a project using the Rust programming language.
It contains a hello world program, readme, license and other files that you would want in any project.

## Getting started

To get started with this project, decide where you will place your local repository and follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a working git installation, a JVM and the Rust compiler.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
    ```sh
    git clone https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-rust.git
    ```
2. Rename the directory
3. Edit the files `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`... and `.gitignore` depending on if you build a library or a binary
4. Start working on your project

### Usage

I recommend that you developr your project in [Rust Rover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust) as it is the best Rust IDE there is.

If you prefer basic text editors like [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can compile the project using the following commands.

```sh
cargo build
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Make Neutronium available for other languages
    - [x] [C](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-c)
    - [x] [C++](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-cpp)
    - [x] [kotlin](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-kotlin)
    - [x] [Lua](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-lua)
    - [x] [Rust](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-rust)
- [ ] Use [Chisel](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/chisel) when it is stable

See the [open issues](https://gitlab.com/ragagno/neutronium-rust/-/issues) for a list of feature requests and known problems.

## Contributing

Contributions are the backbone of the open source community and are greatly appreciated.
You can contribute in several manners.

The first one is to propose a pull request to the project for improving its features directly.

The second one is to open an issue when you encounter a bug or have a feature request.

The third one is to financially support the development of the project.
